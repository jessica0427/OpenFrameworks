I am a UX/UI designer who focuses on understanding users’ behaviors and emotions while applying design thinking to create experiences that delight users in a positive way. I am interested in designing applications, publications, user interfaces while exploring the dialogue between products, people, and contexts. 

Through my past work experiences I've learned conceptual development skills, worked on UX/UI design and worked closely with Art Directors to create advertisements and installations for worldwide known companies. Currently, I am pursuing a Master’s degree in Design and Technology at Parsons School of Design in New York City.
