Project 1

For the first project I wanted to focus on the Japanese anime story called “Weathering with you” which tells the story of a high-school boy who runs away to Tokyo and befriends an orphan girl who has the ability to manipulate the weather. In order to make money, they create a business where the girl gives people a moment of sunshine. Thinking about this concept, I want to create a project that connects the user to the weather. I want them to experience the changes and different moods a storm can bring you and then lead them to the sun at the end. 

Project 2

For my second project I want to use the weather API and connect it to how weather affects the Earth. Weather also affects the way human settlements form on Earth. In areas where the weather makes the climate temperate, people have been able to settle. In modern civilization we can settle just about anywhere, but places with severe weather are also going to be less populated. I want to use the weather api and connect it to things that can be found in nature such as trees or flowers.

Project 3

For my third project I want to create a game where the goal is to find the “sunshine girl.” The idea is to have the main character go through a series of bad weather and obstacles with the goal of getting to the sunshine at the end. I want the user to be able to play with sun, air water, temperature, wind, and precipitation. Dive into a cloud and see what it’s made of. Make it rain, make it snow, or make a thunderstorm. I want to use weather as an interactive model. Kids play and learn about the atmospheric forces that make the weather and affect us everyday.
